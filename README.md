# Students

Just a simple application to see how to build something in python.

## Requirements

* Python 3.11.4

## Run

```
python3 app.py
```

Type `help` for the list of commands.
When you type `end` or `quit` it will show the averages per course per student.

# Evaluation

The good:

  * You can use classes and proper OO.

The bad:

  * Yeah finished the app. Let's run it! O type conversion error... I like strong typed languages I guess.

The ugly:

  * Importing classes is nothing like I am used to in Java and plain weird.
  * Loads of weird functions on the string object but no size or length.. use a function for that?
